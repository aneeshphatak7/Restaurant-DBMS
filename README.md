# Restaurant-DBMS


My project involves building a database model for a restaurant. I plan to use this database model to collect data necessary for deriving knowledge about key numbers such as daily revenue, number of orders, distribution of guests and staff payment information according to tasks completed. This is a massive upgrade to the existing state of affairs in which all information about the orders of the restaurant is stored manually. 
Coming to the layout of the restaurant, this restaurant has three different seating areas. One prohibits alcohol and smoking, the second allows drinking but not smoking and the third allows both. The procedure of placing an order is as follows:
1.	Arriving customers will be greeted by the host, ask about number of people in the group and which section they would like to be seated in. The host will also assign waiters to groups of diners.
2.	The waiter will take orders from tables and bring prepared orders to the table.
3.	The supervisor will keep a track of incoming orders and accordingly assign tasks to the chefs. 
4.	The chefs take instructions from the supervisor, work on their tasks and report to the supervisor after completing their tasks.
5.	The waiters are in charge of billing and payment of a customer. After the payment is done, the waiter informs the manager who then assigns busboys to clean tables after a group leaves. The busboy cleans tables and informs manager who then updates status of the table.
